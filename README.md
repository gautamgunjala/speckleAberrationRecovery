# Speckle aberration recovery


## Introduction
This repository is the open science addition to the research paper "[Extreme ultraviolet microscope characterization using photomask surface roughness](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68588-w)" (Gunjala, 2020), where we demonstrate the use of natural surface roughness to recover the aberrations of a imaging system, in the case of the SHARP EUV microscope ([sharp.lbl.gov](sharp.lbl.gov).)

## Content
This repository has four main folders:

* `data`, where data is available, would want to try your own luck
* `matlab`, where the core simulations and experimental results are available
* `python`, where an open-source version of the experimental processing is available.


## Usage

### MATLAB
### Python

## Examples

## References
The main concept of this paper is based on preliminary research described in the research paper "[Optical transfer function characterization using a weak diffuser](doi.org/10.1117/12.2213271)" (Gunjala, 2016) and proof-of-concept experimentation described in the research paper "[Aberration recovery by imaging a weak diffuser](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.26.021054)" (Gunjala, 2018).
